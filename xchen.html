We will break down our trip for you so that you can get the most out of your vacation in beautiful Turks & Caicos!</p>

				<h2>Entrepreneurship</h2>
				<p>I am a researcher, activist and writer of social entrepreneurship and social innovation. I worked on a research project in Beijing and Shenzhen investigating how Chinese social entrepreneurs help migrant workers integrate into urban society in China. The phenomenon of large-scale rural-urban migration has brought 250 million migrant workers into urban cities in China. Migrant workers face tremendous legal barriers under the hukou system, which excludes non-urban residents from social welfare. Grassroots migrant NGOs emerged as an informal way to provide legal protection and services to migrant workers, however, they have constantly coped with government scrutiny. On January 1st, 2017, the New NGO Law was implemented with the intention of legalizing grassroots NGOs’ status and activities.</p>

				<h2>Background</h2>
				<p>I am specialized in entrepreneurship, impact investing and finance. In the past year, I led MBA teams and undergraduate teams to compete in various business competitions including Tibetan Innovation challenge, Hult Prize and New York Business Plan competition. This past summer I interned for a fintech company "MoneyMatch" to come up with a SEO strategy to improve their website's google organic listing and came up with content for their social media channels. I also worked for a venture capital firm in Kuala Lumpur where I streamlined deal-sourcing and worked with entrepreneurs help them achieve their goals. </p>

				<h2>Extracurriculars</h2>
				<p> The mindfulness community on campus has been a big support of my practice. Last May, I went on a meditation retreat at the Rochester Zen Center. It was very refreshing to see the beautiful architecture and the art work. Being at a beautiful place made my practice very special. It was so important to get fresh perspectives on meditation and have a beginner’s mind. I enjoyed having a community of people around me to support my practice. I sat in a circle of people who I just met but I felt like I have known them for years because meditation has brought us together. I particularly liked the small yoga movements that we did to unwind. It brought awareness to certain parts of my body that I usually do not pay attention to. I had many thoughts about planning out my weekend and getting more work done, but I realized it was not helping my practice. Instead of getting ahead of the present moment, I brought my attention back to my breath. We practiced walking meditation outside and I felt close to the nature and my inner- being. It was a reset button for me to get rejuvenated for a productive week.One of the most helpful part of the course was learning about how to expand my compassion and communicate with empathy.</p>
