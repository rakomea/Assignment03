				<p>I am thinking of graduating from college with a CS degree and working in industry for a bit as my first and default option. After that, I may want to return to school to get my masters or probably a pHD if I'm interested enough at that time. If I don't get a job however, I think I will go straight to graduate school to try and get my masters while working on securing a job during those years. I will also consider research as a possible career track and if I find it interesting enough, I may do a phd and become a faculty member at a University and do research.</p>

				<h2>Entrepreneurship</h2>
				<p>I founded a non-profit organization called Speak to the Nation Inc. in my home country Ghana to help kids from rural areas of the country learn more about the importance of Education by sharing personal experiences and also encouraging them through motivational messages and donating stationary to help them in their journey as students. I also started out as a freelance fronted web developer about a year or two ago. I have worked with a wide range of people in developing websites, applications, teaching students programming, and in other jobs such as being an office assistant and program assistant.</p>

				<h2>Background</h2>
				<p>I was born in a small town in the Eastern Region of Ghana called Aburi. I grew up in this town and attended most of my basic education schools here. I graduated junior high school in 2014 and went about 30 minutes away to a boarding school for my high school education. In high school I studied General Science which was a combination of core subjects English, Social Studies, Mathematics and Integrated Science with my electives being Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Further Mathematics. In high school I also heard about programming and took quite an interest in it. I also loved social activism and being involved in driving social progress by helping out in whatever ways that I could. I loved volunteering, I still do, and anything that had to do with social advancement. After graduating high school, I was faced with the decision of studying in home country or taking an opportunity that was presented to me to be mentored in applying to schools outside my home country, Ghana. I decided to give the latter choice a shot. I took my SATs, wrote lots of essays and ended up applying early decision to the University of Rochester. I got in right away accepted to go there as it was one of the top schools I was looking to attend.</p>

				<h2>Extracurriculars</h2>
				<p>I arrived to College the Summer before the start of my first year to participate in an early connections program called the Summer Start Program which was geered at helping students learn more about the University's campus, make early connections and also get a feel of college classes. I took classes in Engineering, Writing and also in College Success. It was during this period that I decided to switch my inteded major from Electrical and Computer Engineering to Computer Science. During my first year, I was an EcoRep (first year students who promote environmental sustainability in first year housing). I did a lot of volunteer work through this program, which included, developing a website for Grow Green, an off campus garden. I also was involved with still managing my non-profit organization alongside being involved in campus clubs such as the National Society of Black Engineers, the Pan-African Student Association and the Philosophy Council. I was also an eboard member of my scholarship's community engagement committee. I also worked as an Office Assistant in the Hajim School of Engineering Dean's Office. In my second year, I am an International Student Mentor, a first year fellow (academic counselor for first years), and also still work as an Office Assistant in the Hajim School of Engineering Dean's Office and as a program assistant in the David T. Kearns Center. I hope to graduate in 2022 with a bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and  double minors in Philosophy and Psychology.</p>
