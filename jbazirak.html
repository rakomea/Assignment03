				<p>My love for numbers and making a change in the world has resulted in me taking an interest in Business, Computer Science & Robotics. During my Junior year, I went to study abroad in Shanghai, China which was a life changing experience. Aside from the great food that I enjoyed, I got a chance to put my python programming skills into practice. I worked with a startup called, MIRO AI - a sports AI company. They focused on image processing of athletes in marathons. It is through this experience I got a chance to learn more about Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence & the power of Big Data. From then on, my life has never been the same again. I am always looking for opportunities to enhance my knowledge and skills in the Data & the Technology sector. The language I am getting fluent at: python, statistics, machine learning and databases. My hope is that I can work work with numerous companies who have access to large data so that I can do what I do best ~ organize it, analyze it & interpret it to derive the best value.  </p>

				<h2>Entrepreneurship</h2>
				<p>I take pleasure in starting and managing companies. So far, I have two companies legally registered and undergoing development. One is a non-profit entity aimed at empowering young people in my home country and another is a for-profit e-commerce entity in the construction & infrastructure industry. A lot more will be started as long as I am alive. I have attempted many startups in the travel & environmental sustainability industries. As time progresses, I hope to startup & co-found companies in the Robotics, Real Estate, Energy, Agriculture & Logistics industries. The hope is that these companies will get to improve the lives of our humanity and delegate the profit to the right reasons that advance a civilization in the appropriate direction.

				<h2>Extracurriculars</h2>
				<p>My belief in education to make a positive change has always been a driving factor in my academics, work and travel. My hope is that to learn the necessary skills in computer science, finance and management to lead organizations and companies that will make a fundamental change in our world. We are becoming a more interconnected world thanks to technology, common language and easier transportation mechanisms. This gives me optimism as we can always work holistically as humans to advance in technology, protect our environment for future generations and lead a new era of sustainable prosperity.</p>
